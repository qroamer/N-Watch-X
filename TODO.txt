global.c system.c pwrmgr.c - fix up this code! lots of little (but rare) issues with interrupts happening just before going to power down sleep
draw.c - also fix up this, cleanup that struct image_s stuff and maybe convert draw_bitmap_do() to ASM to see if its any faster?
millis.c/millis_isr.s - use flags that are processed in the ISR instead? also reduce millis resolution to 4ms? nothing in the code really needs 1ms res
bool/BOOL
